## MSK Custom plugin to export JMX Metrics for Debezium MySQL connector

### Use Case
Amazon MSK Connect is a feature of Amazon MSK which allows you to run fully managed Apache Kafka Connect workloads on AWS. It simplifies the deployment, monitoring, and automatic scaling of connectors that transfer data between Apache Kafka clusters and external systems such as databases, file systems, and search indices. Amazon MSK Connect is fully compatible with Kafka Connect. It enables you to migrate your Kafka Connect applications as it is without any code modifications. MSK Connect supports Amazon MSK, Apache Kafka, and Apache Kafka compatible clusters as sources and sinks. 

MSK Connect is frequently used for Change Data Capture (CDC), a process of identifying and capturing changes made in a database and delivering those changes in real time to a downstream system. Debezium is an open-source distributed platform which provides CDC functionality and built on top of Apache Kafka. It provides a set of connectors to track and stream changes from databases to Kafka. When using these custom plugins, it becomes crucial to monitor their performance and health to ensure the seamless operation of data pipelines. 

While MSK Connect provides a range of built-in connectors for popular data sources and sinks, it currently does not support exporting JMX metrics natively. MSK Connect enables you to create custom plugins using which you can write custom code to export the JMX metrics. By exporting the JMX metrics with the custom plugin, you can integrate MSK Connect with AWS services like Amazon CloudWatch or external monitoring tools, ensuring comprehensive monitoring and observability for your connectors.
In this solution, we'll demonstrate how to build a custom module for the Debezium MySQL connector plugin to export its JMX metrics and publish them as custom metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.

### Solution Overview
The Debezium MySQL connector provides three types of metrics in addition to the built-in support for JMX metrics that Kafka, and Kafka Connect provide by default. 
  1.	**Snapshot metrics** provide information about connector operation while performing a snapshot.
  2.	**Streaming metrics** provide information about connector operation when the connector is reading the binlog.
  3.	**Schema history** metrics provide information about the status of the connectorâ€™s schema history.

In this code sample, as an example we showcase how to export JMX metric **MilliSecondsBehindDataSource** streaming metric emitted by the Debezium MySQL Connector plugin and publish them as custom metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. This is achieved by creating a custom code wrapper around the Debezium MySQL Connector Plugin. The **MilliSecondsBehindDataSource** metric indicates the number of milliseconds between the timestamp of the last change event and the time when the connector processes it, accounting for any clock differences between the database server and the connector's host machine.

### Architecture

The above architecture demonstrates how we build an Amazon MSK Connect Custom plugin which reports JMX metrics and pushes the metrics to CloudWatch, the high-level steps are as follows
1.	**Create a Custom Module**: Create a new Maven project that will contain your custom code to
  a.	Integrate with Debezium MySQL Connector
  b.	Create a JMX Registry and run it in the worker of the connector
  c.	Create a JMX Metrics Exporter to the JMX Registry, query the metrics and push it to CloudWatch as a custom metric
  d.	Scheduler to run the JMX Metrics Exporter at configured interval
2.	**Package and deploy** the custom module as a MSK Connect Custom Plugin
3.	**Create a connector** using the custom plugin to capture CDC from the source and stream it to the sink.

### Implementation Details
This github project is a sample implementation of the custom code wrapper, built on top of [debezium-connector-mysql-2.5.2.Final-plugin](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-mysql/2.5.2.Final/debezium-connector-mysql-2.5.2.Final-plugin.tar.gz) that:

Creates a new Maven project with dependencies on:
1.	**Debezium MySQL Connector** to integrate with the connector plugin for  the core CDC functionalities 
2.	**Kafka Connect API**  for configuration and 
3.	**CloudWatch AWS SDK** to push the metrics to Amazon CloudWatch
 
**DebeziumMySqlMetricsConnector**: Integrates with the Debezium MySQL Connector by extending MySqlConnector class. This gets you the access to the connector's entry point to execute custom code.This class overrides the start method to get the configuration details, creates a JMX Registry and starts the JMX server. It then schedules the execution of the JMX metrics exporter at regular intervals 

**JMXMetricsExporter:** A custom class for connecting to the JMX Server, querying the MilliSecondBehindSource JMX metric, and converting it into a suitable format for exporting to CloudWatch. It also implements the logic for pushing the JMX metrics to Amazon CloudWatch using the CloudWatch PutMetricData API in AWS SDK for Java.

#### Packaging and deploying the custom plugin
You can either build this project locally and package the Maven project as a jar and include it in the debezium-connector-mysql-2.5.2.Final-plugin. Then package the updated  debezium-connector-mysql-2.5.2.Final-plugin as a zip file and use it as a custom plugin in MSK Connect. Alternatively, you can use the  custom-debezium-mysql-connector-plugin.zip attached as part of this github repository.

#### Create a Connector with the custom plugin
To try this on your AWS account, you can refer to the [Setup](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/24d19e6d-0c60-4732-8861-343f20ef2b7f/en-US/setup) lab in the MSK Connect workshop and follow the instructions below to create the connector:
Upload the custom-debezium-mysql-connector-plugin.zip  to msk-lab-_${ACCOUNT_ID}_-plugins-bucket/debezium path.

On the Amazon MSK console there is a MSK Connect section. choose Custom plugins, then create custom plugin, browse the S3 bucket that you created above and select the custom plugin ZIP file you just uploaded.

Enter custom-debezium-mysql-connector-plugin for the plugin name. Optionally, enter a description and click on **Create Custom Plugin**.

After a few seconds you should see the plugin is created and the status is Active.
Customize the worker configuration for the connector by following the instructions in the [Customise worker configuration](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/24d19e6d-0c60-4732-8861-343f20ef2b7f/en-US/sourceconnectors/source-connector-setup#customise-worker-configuration) lab.

Follow the remaining instructions from the [Create MSK Connector lab](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/24d19e6d-0c60-4732-8861-343f20ef2b7f/en-US/sourceconnectors/source-connector-setup#create-msk-connector) and create the connector. Ensure that the connector status changes to **Running**.

#### Verify the replication in the Kafka cluster and CloudWatch Metrics

Follow the instruction in the [Verify the replication in the Kafka cluster](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/24d19e6d-0c60-4732-8861-343f20ef2b7f/en-US/sourceconnectors/verify-source-connector) lab to setup a client and make changes to the source DB and verify that the changes are captured and sent to Kafka topics by the connector. 
To verify that the connector has published the JMX metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, click on Metrics â†’ All Metrics in the CloudWatch console. Under custom namespace, you can see MSK_Connect with DBServerName as the dimension. Click on DBServerName to view the metrics.

Select the **MilliSecondBehindSource** metric with statistic as Average in the Graphed Metric to plot the graph. You can verify that the MilliSecondBehindSource metric value is greater than zero whenever any operation is being performed on the source database and returns to 0 during the idle time.
